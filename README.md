So this project was an attempt at using OpenCV and Pygame to make a video game, I did manage to succeed somehow with 
a parody of Osu(a rapid mouse clicking game). This was pretty difficult because I need to break down so many subtasks 
to complete the final project. For example, the images for the background and to greyscale to save CPU space and such.
This took me about a month to complete mostly because I was so distracted by the many functions, I forgot what was I
doing. It did almost workout however, I lack enough background images to make this more accurate. Because I used so 
little images so my Mac won't break and I couldn't find much as well. I used a white circle image for the object to 
detect and for the player to control, I tried to use hand images but it failed then my thumb but keeps mistaking my 
forehead for a thumb. I settled for a white circle making it useless in really bright rooms since it wasn't too vague
to confuse it with my forehead.

I will continue to improve on this later on in the future because I am aching for something else to learn. For now its
a project or a new material every month. Until university comes, I will keep up this trend because I am no means an expert
on Python since it has so much stuff to do. It was kinda of fun doing this project since I did learn a lot. For example, plan 
out the subtasks and find the right modules for it.  I rate this 7 / 10. 

1. I learn how to open websites on Python and download the images related links

2. How to train Haar cascades and adjust the images for better results

3. Use a camera as a background for Pygame

4. Make a semi-parody of Osu

Special thanks to these websites for helping my projects came to fruition and my Grade 11 coding too
